## Welcome to the Watch Alarming Sounds Listener app support page
This application monitors sounds around the iPhone including baby cries. When a sound is heard by your iPhone, Apple Watch will alert you with an audible and / or tactile alarm. To do this, both devices must be connected to Wi-Fi. The iPhone's microphone sensitivity can be adjusted in the app. The total amount of the watch haptic alarms in one day is limited to fifty. If the alarm does not work on the watch, the limit is probably reached.
